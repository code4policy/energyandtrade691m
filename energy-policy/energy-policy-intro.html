        <h2>1. Energy Security and Clean Energy Beginnings (2001-2008)</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Post-9/11, the U.S. prioritized energy security, focusing on reducing dependence on foreign oil while exploring clean energy technologies.</p>
        <p><strong>Policy Focus:</strong> Promoted domestic fossil fuel production (shale gas, oil) and supported nuclear energy and biofuel advancements.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Policies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.energy.gov/" target="_blank">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a> - Emphasized clean coal, nuclear energy, and renewable energy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Clean Energy and Climate Change Mitigation (2009-2016)</h2>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> The Obama administration viewed clean energy as a driver of economic recovery and sought to establish the U.S. as a leader in global climate action.</p>
        <p><strong>Policy Focus:</strong> Invested in renewable energy infrastructure (wind, solar) and implemented carbon emission control policies.</p>
