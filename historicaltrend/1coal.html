        <h2>Coal Energy Trend</h2>
        <p>The graph highlights coal energy usage per capita (measured in kWh) from 1990 to 2023. Key observations include China's sharp rise in coal usage per capita since the early 2000s, surpassing the United States around 2015. In contrast, the U.S. shows a significant decline in coal usage over the past two decades, reflecting the countryâ€™s transition towards cleaner energy sources.</p>
        
        <p>Countries such as Australia and South Korea maintain relatively stable coal usage per capita, while others, including Germany and the United Kingdom, show consistent reductions. This trend underscores the global shift in energy strategies, with many countries moving away from coal dependency to combat climate change and embrace renewable energy alternatives.</p>
        
        <p>The data emphasizes the need for policy interventions, technological innovations, and international cooperation to accelerate the transition from coal to sustainable energy systems. China's increasing dependency on coal highlights the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, while the U.S. and European nations showcase the potential for reducing coal reliance through policy-driven approaches.</p>
