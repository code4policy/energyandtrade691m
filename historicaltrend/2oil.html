        <h2>Oil Energy Trend</h2>
        <p>The graph illustrates oil energy consumption per capita (measured in kWh) from 1990 to 2023. Notable trends include Saudi Arabia's peak in oil usage per capita, significantly higher than other nations, followed by a sharp decline in recent years. The United States and Canada remain consistent in their high oil consumption levels, reflecting their energy-intensive economies, while showing a slight downward trend in recent years.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, emerging economies like China exhibit a steady upward trajectory, albeit still at much lower per capita levels compared to developed nations. This increase underscores China's growing energy demands fueled by rapid industrialization and economic growth. European nations like the Netherlands demonstrate relatively stable oil usage, reflecting efficient energy policies and transitions toward renewable sources.</p>
        
        <p>The trends highlight the global disparities in oil consumption and the need for sustainable energy strategies. Countries with high dependency on oil must accelerate their transition to alternative energy sources to reduce carbon emissions and align with global climate goals.</p>
