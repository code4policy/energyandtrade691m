        <h2>Gas Energy Trend</h2>
        <p>The graph highlights gas energy consumption per capita (measured in kWh) from 1990 to 2023. The United States leads in per capita gas usage, showing a consistent upward trend in recent decades, reflecting its substantial reliance on natural gas as a primary energy source. Countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia also maintain high levels of gas consumption, with some fluctuations over the years.</p>
        
        <p>Emerging economies such as China exhibit a steady rise in gas consumption per capita, albeit at much lower levels compared to developed nations. This trend highlights the growing importance of gas as a transitional energy source in the shift toward lower-carbon energy systems. European nations, including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, show moderate and relatively stable gas usage, reflecting their diversified energy portfolios.</p>
        
        <p>These trends underscore the need for further investments in cleaner gas technologies and infrastructure while accelerating transitions to renewable energy sources. Balancing gas usage with carbon reduction targets will be a critical challenge for energy-intensive economies in the coming decades.</p>
