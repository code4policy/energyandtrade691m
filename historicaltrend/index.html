            <h2>Wind</h2>
            <p>The graph shows a remarkable upward trend in wind energy adoption per capita (measured in kWh-equivalent) from 1990 to 2023, highlighting the growing importance of wind energy in global energy transitions. Countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain are leading in wind energy utilization, showcasing their commitment to renewable energy technologies. The United States and China demonstrate a steady and significant increase, reflecting their large-scale investments in wind energy infrastructure.

            <p>This trend underscores the urgency for countries to diversify their energy portfolios and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. The rapid growth in wind energy adoption suggests that wind is becoming a cornerstone of sustainable energy strategies, providing a clear pathway to lower carbon emissions while meeting rising energy demands. This also emphasizes the need for innovative engineering solutions to support and optimize wind energy systems, from turbine design to grid integration.</p>
