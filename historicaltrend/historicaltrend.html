            <h1>Historical Energy Trends</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This page offers a detailed examination of energy consumption trends across a variety of sources, capturing the evolution of global energy usage patterns over decades. 
                Energy trends are shaped by several factors, including population growth, economic development, energy prices, and technological innovations. 
                For instance, the industrial revolution marked a significant shift to coal-powered energy systems, while the post-World War II period saw the rise of oil and gas as dominant energy sources. 
                More recently, the 21st century has witnessed unprecedented growth in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.
            </p>

            <p>
                The historical data presented here highlights regional disparities in energy consumption, with developed nations typically consuming more energy per capita than their developing counterparts. 
                However, emerging economies like China and India have shown rapid increases in energy consumption as they industrialize and urbanize. 
                Conversely, some developed nations have successfully reduced energy usage through efficiency measures and transitions to cleaner energy sources.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
                The analysis reveals several key insights about global energy consumption patterns. 
                One of the most notable trends is the rapid adoption of renewable energy in regions like Europe and the Americas. 
                Countries such as Germany, Denmark, and the United States have invested heavily in solar and wind energy, significantly increasing their share of renewable energy in the overall mix. 
                This shift reflects policy initiatives such as subsidies, tax incentives, and renewable portfolio standards, aimed at fostering the adoption of clean energy technologies.
            </p>

            <h2>Interactive Exploration</h2>
            <p>
                The interactive graphs below provide a deeper dive into specific energy sources, enabling users to explore trends in detail. 
                Each graph visualizes historical data, helping to uncover patterns, identify inflection points, and understand the dynamics driving energy transitions. 
                For example, the solar energy graph highlights exponential growth in adoption rates over the past two decades, particularly in regions with favorable climates and supportive policies.
            </p>

            <p>
                The interactive format allows users to compare energy trends across countries and regions, offering insights into how different nations are progressing in their energy transitions. 
                For instance, users can examine how Germany's Energiewende policy has reshaped its energy landscape, transitioning from coal and nuclear power to wind and solar. 
                Similarly, the data for China illustrates its dual strategy of expanding renewable energy while maintaining coal-powered growth to meet its massive energy demands.
