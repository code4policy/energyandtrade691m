        <h2>Nuclear Energy Trend</h2>
        <p>The graph showcases nuclear energy consumption per capita (measured in kWh-equivalent) from 1990 to 2023. France has consistently led in per capita nuclear energy use, although its usage has seen a decline in recent years, reflecting its partial shift towards renewable energy and policy changes regarding nuclear dependence.</p>
        
        <p>The United States demonstrates stable nuclear energy consumption levels over the years, maintaining its position as a major player in nuclear power. South Korea follows with a steady increase in nuclear energy use, emphasizing its commitment to nuclear energy as a key component of its energy strategy.</p>
        
        <p>China, while at a much lower level, exhibits a notable upward trajectory in nuclear energy adoption, signaling its efforts to diversify its energy mix and reduce carbon emissions. These trends highlight the varying approaches to nuclear energy, with some nations scaling down reliance and others increasing investments in nuclear infrastructure to meet energy and environmental goals.</p>
