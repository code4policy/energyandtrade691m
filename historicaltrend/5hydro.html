        <h2>Hydro Energy Trend</h2>
        <p>The graph illustrates hydro energy consumption per capita (measured in kWh-equivalent) from 1990 to 2023. Canada leads in per capita hydro energy usage, consistently outpacing other nations despite a gradual decline in recent years, reflecting its abundant hydroelectric resources and reliance on this renewable energy source.</p>
        
        <p>Switzerland follows as another significant user of hydro energy, maintaining relatively stable levels over the years. Countries like Brazil and Russia also utilize hydro energy to a notable extent, showcasing the importance of this renewable source in their energy portfolios. Meanwhile, China and the United States show relatively stable but modest per capita usage compared to leading nations.</p>
        
        <p>The trends underscore the importance of hydro energy as a renewable resource, particularly for nations with favorable geographic conditions. However, declining per capita usage in some countries highlights the challenges of balancing environmental considerations with energy demand and the need for investment in modernizing hydroelectric infrastructure.</p>
